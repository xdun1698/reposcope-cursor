## What is RepoScope?

RepoScope is a developer productivity plugin for [Cursor](https://cursor.com) that scans your repo for secrets and risky code, maps it by token cost, and — with Pro — shows what each file costs to analyze with AI. The security scanner and repo map are free on every install.

### Security Scanning — Free

Local, real-time vulnerability detection — **44 detectors** across 14 languages: committed secrets and API/cloud keys (GitHub, Slack, Google, Stripe, JWTs, private keys, DB connection strings, `.env` values), unsafe execution (`eval`, `os.system`, `subprocess`, `child_process`, `Runtime.exec`), framework XSS (`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, Vue `v-html`, Angular bypass), risky config (permissive CORS, disabled TLS verification), weak crypto, and known-vulnerable npm/pip dependencies. Every finding has a **confidence level** and **CWE ID**; the scan yields a **0–100 security score** with a letter grade and trend. Filter/search/group findings, suppress noise with `.reposcope-ignore`, and export the report to JSON. Best-effort and pattern-based — not a substitute for a professional audit.

### Repo Map — Free

Your whole repository at a glance — every source file ranked by token cost with a cost bar, plus the current branch, recent commits, and the files changed in the last commit. Click any file to jump straight to it. Refreshes on save.

### Token Waste Detection — Pro

See exactly which files eat your LLM context budget. BPE-accurate token counts per file let you prune intelligently before sending code to any AI model — saving money and improving output quality.

Track cumulative savings across scans with the built-in Estimated Savings tracker — each re-scan tallies the tokens you've recovered and an estimated dollar amount. Configurable API rate (`reposcope.apiRate`) to match your provider, an optional status-bar total, and a `Copy Savings Summary` command. All local; dollar figures are estimates.

In a typical 40K-line TypeScript repo, 4 files often account for 60–70% of the total BPE token budget — usually auto-generated code or config blobs. Excluding them from AI context means cleaner answers and lower API bills.

**Token Budget Intelligence** adds four more capabilities on top of the per-file ranking: a **Context Overhead Scanner** (estimates the per-prompt token tax from auto-attached rules files, configs, and lockfiles), a **Rules Audit** (flags redundant/duplicated/oversized rules sections with one-click Move to Game Plan / Remove / Apply All, each with diff preview + undo), a **Subscription Runway** tracker (projects when you'll exhaust your monthly token budget — presets prefill an editable budget, not a provider quota), and ranked **Optimization Recommendations** with estimated savings per prompt and per month. All token figures are `~` estimates.

### Game Plan — Pro

AI-powered goal suggestions based on your repo analysis. Track progress, mark goals complete, and use "Fix with Cursor" to resolve issues directly in the editor.

## Install

There are always **two ways to install** — from the marketplace, or manually
from the [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nxgentech/reposcope-ai)
registry. It's the same extension (`nxgentech.reposcope-ai`) either way.

### Cursor

**Way 1 — Cursor Marketplace** _(in review)_
Our Cursor Marketplace listing is pending review. Once approved, search
**"RepoScope"** in `Cmd+Shift+P` → `Cursor: Open Plugin Marketplace` and install
with one click.

**Way 2 — Manual / Open VSX** _(available now)_
Cursor's Extensions panel is backed by Open VSX, where RepoScope is already
published:

1. Open **Extensions** (`Cmd+Shift+X`).
2. Search **RepoScope AI** by publisher **nxgentech** and click **Install**.

Or install the `.vsix` directly:

1. Download the latest `.vsix` from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nxgentech/reposcope-ai).
2. **Extensions ⋯ → Install from VSIX…** and pick the downloaded file.

### VS Code

**Way 1 — VS Marketplace** — click the **Install** badge above, or search
**RepoScope AI** (publisher **nxgentech**) in the Extensions panel (`Cmd+Shift+X`).

**Way 2 — Manual** — from the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) or your terminal:

```
ext install nxgentech.reposcope-ai
code --install-extension nxgentech.reposcope-ai
```

### Windsurf

Windsurf uses Open VSX. Search **RepoScope AI** in the Extensions panel, or
install the `.vsix` from [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/nxgentech/reposcope-ai)
via **Install from VSIX…**.

### One-command install (any editor)

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdun1698/reposcope-cursor/main/scripts/install.sh)
```

The extension auto-registers the bundled Cursor plugin — hooks, skills, and
commands activate immediately on any repo.
